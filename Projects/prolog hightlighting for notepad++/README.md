Download language xml file, store in appropriate place.

Open notepad++.

In the menubar, choose "Language".

From the Language drop down menu, choose "Define you own language...".

In the new window that appears:
	Press the button "Import...".
	locate the stored xml languagefile.
	Press it and then press open.

Restart notepad++.

Now a new language should have appeared in the menubars Language menu, it is probably stored near the end of the list.

The dark themes are more updated than the light themes, my theme of choice is "Zenburn".
